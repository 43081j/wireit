# MVP

- Don't kill watcher when a task fails
- Run command using npx instead of bash
- Watch mode debouncing correctness
- Signal handling
- Respect the configured npm shell
- Linear output mode that prevents interleaving of output
- --watch flag (so that you can do "npm run build -- --watch")
- Ability to say that a task shouldn't block the next step, but still fail
  overall (tsc style).
- Documentation

# V2

- Windows support
- Automatic panels (maybe using tmux)
- Progress bar
