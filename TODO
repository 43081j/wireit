# MVP

- Watch mode debouncing correctness
- Signal handling
- Initial watch build shouldn't wait the 50ms
- Linear output mode that prevents interleaving of output
- --watch flag (so that you can do "npm run build -- --watch")
- Ability to say that a task shouldn't block the next step, but still fail
  overall (tsc style).
- Documentation
- Investigate script-shell
- Test that processes are getting cleaned up
- A way to run scripts like "wireit packages/foo:task"
- Test that output is getting logged

# Followup

- More efficient use of chokidar
- Windows support
- Automatic panels (maybe using tmux)
- Progress bar
- Website
- Bash completion
