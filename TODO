# MVP

- Run command using npx instead of bash
- Watch mode debouncing correctness
- Signal handling
- Respect the configured npm shell
- Initial watch build shouldn't wait the 50ms
- Linear output mode that prevents interleaving of output
- --watch flag (so that you can do "npm run build -- --watch")
- Ability to say that a task shouldn't block the next step, but still fail
  overall (tsc style).
- Documentation
- Test that processes are getting cleaned up
- Make cleanup always run even when uvu test fails

# Followup

- Windows support
- Automatic panels (maybe using tmux)
- Progress bar
- Website
