# MVP

- Watch mode should reload configs when the configs change
- Bug where we have to sleep before closing down watch mode or else we get error
- Bug where pending processes don't exit
- Test that changing the command invalidates the cache
- Test that processes are getting cleaned up
- Test that output is getting logged
- Documentation
- Usability problems
  - Typing "cmd" instead of "command" and nothing happening
  - Bug where after a failed "tsc" watch mode didn't re-run
  - Need indication about what's running
  - Forgetting the "tasks" object
  - Glob patterns that don't match any files (warn or error)
- Names
  - wireit
  - grum
  - run2
  - atr (another task runner)
  - xenomorph
  - zaatar
  - mechane
  - mecharun
  - mechabuild
  - mechascript
  - mechbuild

# Followup

- Ability to say that a task shouldn't block the next step, but still fail
  overall (tsc style).
- More efficient use of chokidar
- What happens if you run two command simultaneously
- Windows support
- Linear output mode that prevents interleaving of output
- Automatic panels (maybe using tmux)
- Progress bar
- Website
- Bash completion
- Build multiple packages (... etc. syntax)
- A way to run scripts like "wireit packages/foo:task"
- Investigate script-shell
- A way for a program to report whether it actually "ran" or not (maybe it can
  output a special string to its stdout, like in GitHub actions). Example can
  show writing a small script and using `|` to check the status.
- More advanced caching
- Better server support (e.g. how to know which inputs require reload)
- Lint this repo
