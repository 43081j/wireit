# MVP

- Test that changing the command invalidates the cache
- What happens if you run two command simultaneously
- Watch mode should reload configs when the configs change.
- Linear output mode that prevents interleaving of output
- --watch flag (so that you can do "npm run build -- --watch")
- Ability to say that a task shouldn't block the next step, but still fail
  overall (tsc style).
- Documentation
- Investigate script-shell
- Bug where we have to sleep before closing down watch mode or else we get error
- Bug where pending processes don't exit
- Test that processes are getting cleaned up
- Test that output is getting logged

# Followup

- More efficient use of chokidar
- Windows support
- Automatic panels (maybe using tmux)
- Progress bar
- Website
- Bash completion
- Build multiple packages (... etc. syntax)
- A way to run scripts like "wireit packages/foo:task"
